# Sign and notarize the darwin ck-insula archive, in the order the checksum needs.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: an ad-hoc signed binary carrying a browser's
# `com.apple.quarantine` attribute does not fail on macOS -- it HANGS. No output,
# no error, no dialog. Measured on this project's own v0.1.0 asset: the same
# bytes fetched with curl answer `ck-insula 0.1.0` instantly, and the copy with a
# Safari-shaped quarantine attribute was still blocked when killed at 25s. The
# installer's curl path never sets that attribute, so this is invisible to every
# check a publisher naturally runs, and lands only on people who download from
# the release page -- which for a public alpha is the people evaluating us.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING AND THE CALLER MUST NOT REARRANGE IT:
#
#     build -> SIGN the binary -> package the zip -> NOTARIZE + staple the zip
#           -> checksum the zip -> upload
#
# Signing mutates the binary and stapling mutates the ZIP, so a checksum taken
# before either covers bytes that are no longer the ones published. That failure
# is silent here and loud for the user: `shasum -c` mismatches on a file we said
# was correct, which is indistinguishable from tampering -- the exact thing a
# checksum exists to detect, manufactured by us.
